# Trip planner

### The project is submitted to the hackathon Funathon 2022

## Inspiration

Throughout our lives, people have thought that because we keep traveling and searching for new things to do, we are not focused. They have often thought we were flaky or unfocused. But travel helped us find our purpose and put focus into our lives. The more we got lost in our travels, the richer our lives became.

Even if you are not traveling, you need to step out of your comfort zone. Be it taking on a new project, opening a business, or enrolling in a course. When you do something that scares you a little, you can do something great.

Travel opens our minds and heart and makes us better people.

## What it does

Trip Planner is a web application which aims to improve trip planning. You can sign up for an account, and then you are able to search locations for tours. You can see the listings of places, and you are able to filter these listings by location and by preferences. Once you find a places which you would like to plan tour, you can click on the 'location' button which will allow you to directly see the images of the location and know more.

It Helps Users to Explore the Best Places to Travel. It Allows Users to Find Best Places, Discover the World and Explore Its Wonders. Tours, Attractions and More.

## How we built it

The application was created using Next for the frontend. It was styled in TailwindCSS and includes several features such as specific components from Redux and React-DOM. The backend is powered by node.js and the listings are stored in MongoDB. They are queried by the filter using SQL Alchemy. The website hosted on Vercel. The map data was generated from the Google Maps API.

## Challenges we ran into

I ran into many challenges during this project including not being able to get MongoDB to connect until I changed around the code, and having a single colon in the wrong place messing up my entire app :) However, the biggest challenge was being unable to find a teammate who could help me develop my idea so I had to work extra hard to create it myself.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am very happy of finishing this project in the timeframe, and including all the features I wanted to use :)

## What we learned

I learned about creating responsive applications in react.

## What's next for Trip Planner

I hope to continue working on this application to include a profile page and a way to include the Google Maps API :)
